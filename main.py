"""
An efficient solution would need only one traversal i.e. O(n) on the longer string s1. Here we will start traversing the
 string s1 and maintain a pointer for string s2 from 0th index. For each iteration we compare the current character in s1
  and check it with the pointer at s2. If they match we increment the pointer on s2 by 1. And for every mismatch we set
  the pointer back to 0. We also keep a check when the s2 pointer value is equal to the length of string s2, if true we
  break and return the value (pointer of string s1 â€“ pointer of string s2)
